title: WebSocket and socket.io, so what does socket mean exactly?
---

In the bootcamp, there was a tiny class of socket.io during building up the final project. I was doing things for the web app in a hurry and our web app didn't have feature of realtime thing so I didn't participite in that class.
When I saw some other colleagues projects that contain realtime chat I was so surprised and it looked so nice and I thought I'd learn it later.

These days I'm doing zoom clone course of Nomad Coders, and the main feature is socket.io! I was listening and doing what teacher explained about WebSocket and socket.io and suddenly I had a question. So what does the socket mean exactly...? I just had the image of the bulb socket in my mind, becuase in Korean the word socket(소켓) is used as bulb socket. 

And this time without exception there were seniors(probably) that had the exactly same question. Here is ["What exactly is socket"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16233193/what-exactly-is-socket).
One of the comments was about this document ["Socket in Computer Network"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-in-computer-network/). But I think the simplest definition could be "socket is used for real time data transfer between server and client" of the comments.
