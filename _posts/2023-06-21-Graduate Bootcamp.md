title: Graduate Bootcamp and Code Challenge of Nomad Coders
---

Last month I graduated Ironhack Bootcamp and now I'm in Job "Hunt" process. I know that it will be tough and time-consuming. I knew it before too, but knowing and going through it is different.

Because of work schedule, I'm not spending a lot of time on searching job yet. Last week I applied 5 jobs and got 3 rejected. Don't get tired, myself!

Since I don't have any mandatory studying after the bootcamp, I knew I would slack off. 
So I signed up for Nomad Coder's JS challenge and am participating. 

I'm reviewing the basics of JS, which I think is very useful. Moreover I discovered new stuffs like "copy" of events 
```js
window.addEventListener("copy", handleWindowCopy)
```
and understood why it's better that the KEY(string) is written&saved in CAPITAL letters as a variable.
```js
const USERNAME_KEY = "username"
```
