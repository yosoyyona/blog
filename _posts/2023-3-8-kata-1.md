title: Codewar | kata - 1
---

Few weeks ago during the first module of bootcamp I did some basic katas in the Codewar. 

Today, because I had free time before the work of this month, I tried to do it again. 


## [Persistent Bugger](https://www.codewars.com/kata/55bf01e5a717a0d57e0000ec/train/javascript)

To solve the kata I searched following things.
- how to count number's digit(number to string) : .toString() and .length
- string to array : .toString().split('')
- Array.forEach / Array.reduce
- do { statement } while(condition)

Getting error, searching another method and editing the code, I was 80% sure for this code to success. 

```javascript
function persistence(num) {
   //code here
  const arrayNum = num.toString().split('')
  let digit = arrayNum.length
  let result, arrayResult
  
  if(digit === 1) return 0
  else
    {
      result = arrayNum.reduce((acc, curr) => acc * curr, 1)
      if(result.length == 1) 
        {
          arrayResult = result.toString().split('')
          return result
        }
      else
        {
          do
            {
              result = arrayResult.reduce((acc, curr) => acc * curr, 1)
              arrayResult = result.toString().split('')
            } while(arrayResult.length == 1)
              
          return result
        }
    }
}
```

And for sure I got this error message.
```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reduce')
    at persistence (test.js:21:36)
    at Context.<anonymous> (test.js:37:24)
    at process.processImmediate (node:internal/timers:471:21)
```
Well, at the moment I don't know what I have to change. 
So I write down here and later-when I am able to solve it or when I rank up to access to the solution of this kata-I will check again.
